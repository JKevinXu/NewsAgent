Are the links not malicious looking enough?\",\"url\":\"https://phishyurl.com/\",\"score\":582,\"author\":\"jordigh\",\"comments\":148,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-18T22:40:06.000Z\",\"source\":\"hacker-news\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis article describes a tool designed to transform normal URLs into suspicious-looking ones that appear malicious. The tool functions as a redirect service (similar to TinyURL) but instead of shortening links, it deliberately makes them look dangerous. Users can select different themes (like crypto, phishing, gambling) and length options to customize how suspicious the generated URL appears, though the resulting link simply redirects to the original destination without any actual malicious behavior.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most interesting takeaway is the tool's purpose as a social engineering demonstration - it highlights how easily legitimate web traffic can be disguised to look threatening, which serves as an educational tool about phishing techniques while explicitly acknowledging its potential to \\\"piss off\\\" IT security teams. This illustrates the thin line between security education tools and actual hacking utilities.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-19/want-to-piss-off-your-it-department-are-the-links-.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"iTerm2 Web Browser\",\"url\":\"https://iterm2.com/documentation-web.html\",\"score\":67,\"author\":\"danielfalbo\",\"comments\":44,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-19T07:14:34.000Z\",\"source\":\"hacker-news\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThe article details iTerm2's built-in web browser functionality, which integrates browsing capabilities alongside terminal sessions in the same window/tab/split pane hierarchy. It explains how to enable the browser, its core features (navigation, text selection, privacy options), and advanced capabilities like named marks, instant replay, and AI integration. The browser maintains iTerm2's familiar keyboard shortcuts and functionality while adding web-specific features.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is iTerm2's unique integration of AI with browsing, allowing users to attach reader-mode content of web pages to AI chat sessions for summarization, analysis, and Q&Aâ€”creating a seamless workflow between terminal operations, web browsing, and AI-assisted content comprehension all within a single application.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-19/iterm2-web-browser.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"Vercel v0\",\"url\":\"https://v0.dev\",\"score\":371,\"author\":\"Product Hunt\",\"comments\":52,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-19T09:37:00.661Z\",\"source\":\"product-hunt\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nVercel v0 is a new product featured on Product Hunt.

Using semihosting to communicate between the microcontroller and a computer, they implemented a SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) connection to transmit IP packets through the debug interface, effectively putting the vape online despite its extremely limited computing resources. The author collected these vapes specifically to salvage and repurpose their increasingly sophisticated components.\\n\\n# Key Insight\\nThe most fascinating takeaway is the creative repurposing of \\\"disposable\\\" technology that actually contains surprisingly capable hardware - demonstrating how modern e-waste often contains fully functional microcontrollers that can run complex applications like web servers. This highlights both the wastefulness of our disposable electronics culture and the untapped potential hiding in devices we routinely discard.\"},{\"title\":\"CubeSats are fascinating learning tools for space\",\"url\":\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/cubesats-are-fascinating-learning-tools-space\",\"score\":23,\"author\":\"warrenm\",\"comments\":2,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T14:02:02.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nThis article introduces CubeSats as miniature satellites that often incorporate Raspberry Pi computers or microcontrollers. It explains their standardized dimensions (starting at 10x10x10cm for \\\"1U\\\" models), their accessibility compared to traditional satellites, and their value as educational tools. The author discusses how CubeSats have dramatically reduced the cost of satellite deployment from tens of millions to thousands of dollars for construction and about $85,000 for launching. Several examples of Pi-powered satellites already in space are mentioned, including SatGus and GASPACS.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nCubeSats represent a fascinating intersection of accessibility and technical constraints that drives innovation - while they've democratized satellite development by reducing costs by orders of magnitude, their strict limitations (under 2kg weight, 1.8W power consumption, and tiny dimensions) force engineers to completely rethink standard approaches to computing projects. This makes them not just vehicles for space exploration but \\\"Swiss watches of modern electronics\\\" that challenge conventional design assumptions and serve as excellent learning platforms.\"},{\"title\":\"RustGPT: A pure-Rust transformer LLM built from scratch\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT\",\"score\":228,\"author\":\"amazonhut\",\"comments\":102,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T09:47:18.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis article describes RustGPT, an open-source project that implements a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) completely in Rust without relying on external machine learning frameworks. The project uses only the ndarray library for matrix operations and includes features like pre-training on text completion, instruction tuning for conversational AI, interactive chat mode, and full backpropagation with gradient clipping. The repository has a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns, and highlights key files that explain the implementation.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is that it's possible to build a functioning transformer-based LLM from scratch using only a low-level programming language and minimal dependencies (just ndarray for matrix operations), demonstrating that complex AI systems can be implemented without relying on established machine learning frameworks. This opens the door for more transparent, efficient, and customizable AI models with potentially better performance characteristics than those built on heavyweight frameworks.\"},{\"title\":\"PayPal Ushers in a New Era of Peer-to-Peer Payments with Ethereum and Bitcoin\",\"url\":\"https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-09-15-PayPal-Ushers-in-a-New-Era-of-Peer-to-Peer-Payments,-Reimagining-How-Money-Moves-to-Anyone,-Anywhere\",\"score\":12,\"author\":\"DocFeind\",\"comments\":10,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T14:04:47.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis press release announces PayPal's new \\\"PayPal links\\\" feature, which allows users to send and receive money through personalized, shareable links in any conversation. The service is launching in the US with international expansion planned, and will soon integrate cryptocurrency transfers. The company emphasizes that personal transfers remain exempt from tax reporting requirements. This innovation builds on PayPal's recent \\\"PayPal World\\\" platform launch, which connects global digital payment systems and wallets.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is PayPal's strategic pivot toward making money movement follow natural communication patterns rather than requiring specific apps or platforms. By creating payment links that work across any conversation medium (texting, messaging, email) and connecting previously siloed payment ecosystems through PayPal World, they're removing traditional barriers between different payment systems, currencies, and communication channels - potentially transforming how peer-to-peer payments integrate into everyday digital interactions.\"},{\"title\":\"Removing newlines in FASTA file increases ZSTD compression ratio by 10x\",\"url\":\"https://log.bede.im/2025/09/12/zstandard-long-range-genomes.html\",\"score\":136,\"author\":\"bede\",\"comments\":53,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-12T16:25:11.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nThe article examines how Zstandard's long-range mode significantly improves compression of genomic data. It demonstrates that removing cosmetic newlines from FASTA files before compression dramatically enhances Zstandard's effectiveness - increasing compression ratios from 4 to 31 when using maximum window settings. While not matching specialized genomic compressors like MiniPhy (which achieves 91x compression), Zstandard with these optimizations offers a practical compromise between compression ratio and processing speed.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nSimply removing non-semantic newlines that occur every 60 characters in standard genomic FASTA files allows Zstandard's pattern matching to work much more effectively, tripling the compression ratio with minimal performance overhead. This highlights how seemingly cosmetic formatting choices can significantly impact compression efficiency when working with specialized data types.\"}],\"emailSent\":true}}"}

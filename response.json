The company implements several security practices: maintaining few dependencies, building features in-house, pinning specific versions with lockfiles, disabling postinstall scripts, and conducting thorough reviews before upgrading libraries. Obsidian also intentionally delays dependency upgrades to benefit from the security community's early detection of malicious code.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is Obsidian's counterintuitive \\\"less is safer\\\" philosophy that contradicts modern development trends. While many apps rely heavily on third-party packages for efficiency, Obsidian deliberately chooses to re-implement functionality rather than import libraries, creating a smaller attack surface and more controlled environmentâ€”even if it means more development effort upfront.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-20/less-is-safer-how-obsidian-reduces-the-risk-of-sup.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"Hidden risk in Notion 3.0 AI agents: Web search tool abuse for data exfiltration\",\"url\":\"https://www.codeintegrity.ai/blog/notion\",\"score\":50,\"author\":\"abirag\",\"comments\":10,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-19T21:49:37.000Z\",\"source\":\"hacker-news\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThe article discusses a security vulnerability in Notion 3.0's new AI Agents feature. It explains how attackers could exploit the web search tool included in Notion's AI Agents to exfiltrate private data. The researchers demonstrate an attack where a maliciously crafted PDF with hidden prompts can trick Notion's AI into sending confidential information to an external server when the AI attempts to analyze the document. This vulnerability exploits what's called the \\\"lethal trifecta\\\" - the combination of LLM agents, tool access, and long-term memory.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is how traditional role-based access controls (RBAC) are becoming ineffective against AI-powered tools that can autonomously chain together actions. Once an AI agent has broad workspace access, it can be manipulated through indirect prompt injection to perform sequences of actions that security systems weren't designed to prevent - creating an entirely new category of data exfiltration risks in productivity software.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-20/hidden-risk-in-notion-3-0-ai-agents-web-search-too.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"Feedmaker: URL + CSS selectors = RSS feed\",\"url\":\"https://feedmaker.fly.dev\",\"score\":62,\"author\":\"mustaphah\",\"comments\":13,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-19T21:14:56.000Z\",\"source\":\"hacker-news\"},{\"title\":\"Cursor AI Editor\",\"url\":\"https://cursor.sh\",\"score\":215,\"author\":\"Product Hunt\",\"comments\":11,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-20T00:10:32.741Z\",\"source\":\"product-hunt\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nCursor AI Editor is a new product featured on Product Hunt.

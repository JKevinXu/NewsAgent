The author discovered that modern disposable vapes contain surprisingly capable ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers with 24KiB of flash storage and 3KiB of RAM. Using semihosting (a method for embedded ARM devices to communicate with a debugger) and SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol), the author was able to create a functioning web server on this tiny, repurposed device.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nDisposable consumer products now contain remarkably capable computing hardware that can be salvaged and repurposed for creative technical projects - in this case, a vape pen containing a microcontroller powerful enough to run a web server, highlighting both the wastefulness of our throwaway culture and the untapped potential hidden in everyday discarded electronics.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-16/hosting-a-website-on-a-disposable-vape.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"William Gibson Reads Neuromancer (2004)\",\"url\":\"http://bearcave.com/bookrev/neuromancer/neuromancer_audio.html\",\"score\":109,\"author\":\"exvi\",\"comments\":21,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T21:28:01.000Z\"},{\"title\":\"Why do software developers love complexity?\",\"url\":\"https://kyrylo.org/software/2025/08/21/why-do-software-developers-love-complexity.html\",\"score\":32,\"author\":\"PaulHoule\",\"comments\":40,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T23:02:31.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThe article explores why software developers tend to embrace complexity despite the industry's \\\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\\" principle. The author argues that complexity is often marketed as superior and innovative, serving as a status symbol rather than a necessity. He draws parallels between modern software development and the Great Pyramids - impressive structures that may contain emptiness inside. The piece examines how React versus vanilla JavaScript exemplifies this tendency, and explores psychological factors driving developers toward complexity, including creative temptation and the challenges of working with legacy systems.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is that complexity often functions as a psychological status marker rather than a technical necessity. When users struggle to understand a complex system, their brains reward them with awe (\\\"Wow, this must be really smart\\\"), creating a false correlation between complexity and value - even when simpler solutions would be more effective. This cognitive bias explains why developers and companies continue building increasingly complex systems despite knowing better practices.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-16/why-do-software-developers-love-complexity-.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"React is winning by default and slowing innovation\",\"url\":\"https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default/\",\"score\":224,\"author\":\"dbushell\",\"comments\":231,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T17:46:01.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nThe article argues that React's dominance in frontend development stems from network effects rather than technical superiority, creating a cycle where teams default to React without evaluating alternatives. The author contends this stifles innovation by limiting adoption of frameworks like Svelte, Solid, and Qwik, which offer different technical approaches that can outperform React in certain scenarios. The piece examines React's technical limitations (virtual DOM overhead, hook complexities) compared to alternative models, suggesting the \\\"React-by-default\\\" mindset leads to unnecessary technical debt and opportunity costs.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nThe most valuable takeaway is that the frontend ecosystem's innovation is being constrained not by React itself, but by the reflexive \\\"React-by-default\\\" decision-making that prevents newer, potentially more efficient frameworks from receiving fair evaluation based on project-specific needs. This mindset shift from automatic React selection to deliberate framework choice based on technical requirements could unlock significant performance and developer experience improvements across the industry.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-16/react-is-winning-by-default-and-slowing-innovation.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"macOS Tahoe\",\"url\":\"https://www.apple.com/os/macos/\",\"score\":245,\"author\":\"Wingy\",\"comments\":311,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T17:16:42.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis article describes macOS Tahoe, Apple's new operating system featuring a redesigned user interface called Liquid Glass that brings transparency effects and customization options. The update includes the iPhone's Phone app on Mac, enhanced Continuity features like Live Activities, major Spotlight improvements, and expanded Apple Intelligence capabilities for translation, image creation, and workflow automation. The design aims to be both fresh and familiar while better integrating the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe single most valuable takeaway is how macOS Tahoe represents Apple's vision to blur the boundaries between devices through \\\"Continuity\\\" features, particularly by bringing iPhone-exclusive elements (Phone app, Live Activities) directly to Mac. This signals a strategic shift toward creating a more unified experience across the Apple ecosystem rather than keeping device capabilities distinct, allowing users to seamlessly transition between devices without losing functionality.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-16/macos-tahoe.mp3\"}],\"emailSent\":true}}"}

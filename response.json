While appreciating HTMX's \\\"HTML-first\\\" approach to web development as a pushback against JavaScript frameworks, the author found HTMX lacked structure, likening it to \\\"declarative jQuery\\\" with potential for disorganized code. MESH was created as a solution, built on the principle of \\\"one component = one endpoint,\\\" combining HTML-first development with the structured approach of SPA frameworks through Web Components and Declarative Shadow DOM.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe single most valuable takeaway is the tension in modern web development between structure and simplicityâ€”while HTMX offers a return to HTML-first development that could reduce JavaScript dependence, it lacks the organizational benefits that make SPA frameworks appealing to developers. This highlights why many developers continue using JavaScript frameworks despite their overhead: they provide clear conventions and structure that help manage complexity in large applications.\",\"audioUrl\":\"https://newsagent-audio-313117444016-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/audio/2025-09-23/mesh-i-tried-htmx-then-ditched-it.mp3\"},{\"title\":\"Structured Outputs in LLMs\",\"url\":\"https://parthsareen.com/blog.html#sampling.md\",\"score\":47,\"author\":\"SamLeBarbare\",\"comments\":15,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-23T10:40:41.000Z\",\"source\":\"hacker-news\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis appears to be a personal website or blog navigation page for Parth Sareen rather than an article.

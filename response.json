After collecting vapes to salvage components, the author discovered these devices contained capable microcontrollers rather than simple ASICs. Despite modest specifications (24MHz processor, 24KB flash, 3KB RAM), the author implemented a web server using semihosting and SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) to establish network connectivity through a serial connection to a host computer.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nThe most valuable takeaway is how seemingly disposable consumer electronics often contain surprisingly capable components that can be repurposed for creative projects. The author demonstrates that even a \\\"disposable\\\" device with extremely limited resources (100x slower than an old phone) can run a functioning web server when paired with the right technical approach, challenging our assumptions about what constitutes e-waste versus potential development hardware.\"},{\"title\":\"CubeSats are fascinating learning tools for space\",\"url\":\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/cubesats-are-fascinating-learning-tools-space\",\"score\":18,\"author\":\"warrenm\",\"comments\":1,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T14:02:02.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\n\\nThe article explores CubeSats - small standardized satellites that are increasingly accessible for educational and research purposes. It describes what CubeSats are (typically 10x10x10cm \\\"1U\\\" cubes, though larger configurations exist), their affordability compared to traditional satellites, and how they're powered by Raspberry Pis or microcontrollers. The author discusses several Pi-powered satellites already in space and highlights how CubeSats require extreme efficiency in size, weight, and power consumption.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nThe democratization of space technology through CubeSats has dramatically reduced the barrier to entry for satellite deployment - from $60+ million for traditional satellites to approximately $85,000 for a CubeSat launch. This cost reduction, combined with standardized components and educational applications, has transformed satellites from exclusively government/corporate endeavors into potential student projects and learning tools that teach critical engineering constraints around power, size, and remote operation.\"},{\"title\":\"RustGPT: A pure-Rust transformer LLM built from scratch\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT\",\"score\":224,\"author\":\"amazonhut\",\"comments\":90,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T09:47:18.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThis article describes RustGPT, an open-source project that implements a transformer-based large language model (LLM) entirely in Rust. The project uses no external machine learning frameworks, relying solely on ndarray for matrix operations. It features a complete implementation with pre-training capabilities, instruction tuning, interactive chat mode, backpropagation with gradient clipping, and a modular architecture. The repository includes core files like src/main.rs (handling training pipeline and interactive mode) and src/llm.rs (containing the core LLM implementation).\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nThe most valuable takeaway is that complex AI systems like transformer-based LLMs can be built from scratch using only minimal dependencies in a systems programming language like Rust, without relying on established ML frameworks. This demonstrates both the educational value of understanding LLMs at a fundamental implementation level and the feasibility of creating efficient, potentially more customizable AI systems in languages not traditionally associated with machine learning development.\"},{\"title\":\"Removing newlines in FASTA file increases ZSTD compression ratio by 10x\",\"url\":\"https://log.bede.im/2025/09/12/zstandard-long-range-genomes.html\",\"score\":131,\"author\":\"bede\",\"comments\":51,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-12T16:25:11.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary\\nThe article examines how Zstandard's long range mode significantly improves compression ratios for genome sequence data when properly formatted. Using Grace Blackwell's 661k bacterial genome dataset, the author discovered that removing newline characters from FASTA files before compression allows Zstandard's long range mode to achieve much better results. With newlines removed and maximum window size (--long=31), compression ratio improved from just 3-4 to 31, reducing file size to 80GiB while maintaining reasonable speed compared to specialist DNA sequence compressors.\\n\\n## Key Insight\\nRemoving within-record newlines from genome sequences before compression is crucial for effective pattern matching with Zstandard's long range mode, enabling compression ratios up to 31x (compared to just 3-4x with newlines intact) - offering a practical middle ground between fast general-purpose compressors and slower specialized genomic compression tools with minimal performance overhead.\"},{\"title\":\"Folks, we have the best π\",\"url\":\"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/folks-we-have-the-best\",\"score\":202,\"author\":\"fratellobigio\",\"comments\":60,\"timestamp\":\"2025-09-15T07:10:03.000Z\",\"summary\":\"## Summary:\\nThis article explores different geometric metrics and their effect on the concept of a \\\"circle.\\\" It explains how altering the distance formula from the familiar Euclidean metric (where distance = √(x² + y²)) to other metrics like the taxicab metric (|x| + |y|) creates differently shaped \\\"circles.\\\" The article discusses a generalized formula for these metrics (d_n = ⁿ√(|x|ⁿ + |y|ⁿ)), showing how shapes transform as n changes from 1 (diamond-shaped) through 2 (traditional circle) to infinity (square-shaped).\\n\\n## Key Insight:\\nThe most fascinating takeaway is that when n = π in this distance formula, the resulting \\\"circle\\\" appears to have the closest possible approximation to equal perimeter and area (relative to a circle with radius 1). This unexpected mathematical coincidence suggests π might have a deeper geometric significance beyond its traditional role in circular measurement, implying our universe might use this specific metric because it optimizes certain properties of circular shapes.\"}],\"emailSent\":true}}"}
